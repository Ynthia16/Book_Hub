Book Hub: A React Discovery App
Book Hub is a web application that allows users to discover and explore books. The app provides a seamless user experience with a modern frontend built using React and TypeScript, and a backend powered by FastAPI to handle book data storage and retrieval. It integrates both components for an efficient book discovery experience.

Project Goals
Develop a user-friendly interface for browsing books.
Implement functionalities for filtering and searching books by genre, author, publication date, and more.
Utilize React and TypeScript for a responsive, dynamic frontend.
Design a backend API to manage book data, including book listing, details, and filters.
Integrate the frontend and backend for a seamless, interactive experience.
Technical Specifications
Frontend (React with TypeScript)
React is used for building the user interface, and TypeScript is used to enforce type safety and improve code maintainability.
Components for:
Displaying book listings.
Viewing individual book details.
Implementing search and filter functionality (by title, author, genre, etc.).
Pagination of book listings.
Responsive design to ensure the app works across different screen sizes.
State Management: Utilized React's Context API for managing application state across components.
UI Libraries: Tailwind CSS for custom, responsive styling.
Backend (FastAPI)
FastAPI is used to create a RESTful API to handle CRUD operations for book data.
PostgreSQL (or another database) is used for storing and retrieving book information.
API endpoints include:
Fetching a list of books.
Retrieving individual book details.
Filtering books by genre, publication date, or author.
Implement pagination for the book listings to ensure efficient data retrieval.
Database
The backend uses PostgreSQL (or MongoDB) for storing book data.
Schema includes fields such as title, author, publicationDate, genre, and description.
User Experience & Functionality
Search Functionality: Users can search books by title, author, or genre.
Filter: Users can filter books based on various criteria like genre, author, and publication year.
Pagination: Displays a limited number of books per page to enhance user experience.
Responsive Design: Fully mobile-responsive UI using Tailwind CSS.
Next and Previous Buttons: Users can navigate between pages of book listings.
